In case of equal version priorities, the version string will be used to compute the order inside a group. If the version string is \"kube-like\", it will sort above non \"kube-like\" version strings, which are ordered lexicographically. \"Kube-like\" versions start with a \"v\", then are followed by a number (the major version), then optionally the string \"alpha\" or \"beta\" and another number (the minor version). These are sorted first by GA > beta > alpha (where GA is a version with no suffix such as beta or alpha), and then by comparing major version, then minor version. An example sorted list of versions: v10, v2, v1, v11beta2, v10beta3, v3beta1, v12alpha1, v11alpha2, foo1, foo10."}}}},{"2":{"Name":"IoK8SKubeAggregatorPkgApisApiregistrationV1ServiceReference","Properties":{"name":{"Type":4,"Flags":0,"Description":"Name is the name of the service"},"namespace":{"Type":4,"Flags":0,"Description":"Namespace is the namespace of the service"},"port":{"Type":3,"Flags":0,"Description":"If specified, the port on the service that hosting webhook.
