# What is Radius Bicep

This is a fork of the official [Azure Bicep](https://github.com/Azure/bicep) to support [Radius](https://github.com/project-radius/radius). This fork is temporary while we upstream our extensibility updates to the official Bicep repository. For all you need to know about the Bicep language, check out the [Bicep documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/).

Refer to the [Azure Bicep](https://github.com/Azure/bicep) to understand more about the Bicep language and its internal workings.

## What is Radius?

Radius is a platform for developers and IT operators building cloud-native applications. With Radius, teams can model, deploy, manage, and troubleshoot entire applications across on-premises and multi-cloud environments, with a consistent set of tools and a common experience across it all. More information about Radius can be found [here](https://docs.radapp.dev/).

## How does Radius Bicep work?

First, author your Radius application using the Bicep language service as part of the [Radius Bicep VS Code extension](https://docs.radapp.dev/getting-started/install/#setup-vs-code).

Install [Radius CLI](https://docs.radapp.dev/getting-started/install/#install-rad-cli) and set up a [Radius environment](https://docs.radapp.dev/author-apps/dev-environment/initialize-environment/)

Then, use the Radius CLI to compile your Bicep code and deploy your application to your Radius environment.

```bash
rad deploy app.bicep
```
